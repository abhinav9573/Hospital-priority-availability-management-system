## About }
### **The problem is inefficient management of patient queues, blood inventory, and doctor registration in healthcare facilities. Traditional methods lead to delays in patient care, difficulties in maintaining blood supplies, and cumbersome administrative processes. Our objective is to develop a Hospital Management System using advanced data structures and algorithms to streamline these processes, optimize resource utilization, and improve overall healthcare efficiency.**

## Data Structure Used :
### 1 . ***Patient Queue :*** Utilizes a linked list to manage patient admission and prioritize based on severity.
### 2 . ***Blood Inventory :*** Employing arrays to track blood units for different blood types ensures efficient blood inventory management.
### 3 . ***Doctor Management :*** Doctors' names are stored in an array, facilitating registration and management within the system.
### 4 . ***Priority Queue Algorithm :*** Implemented for patient addition, ensuring efficient handling of patients based on their severity.
