## 🏥 Project: Hospital Priority & Availability Management System

## 🎯 Theme: Algorithms and Data Structures

---

## 📝 About

The problem is **inefficient management of patient queues, blood inventory, and doctor registration** in healthcare facilities.  
Traditional methods lead to:
- Delays in patient care
- Difficulties in maintaining blood supplies
- Cumbersome administrative processes

Our objective is to develop a **Hospital Management System** using advanced data structures and algorithms to:
- Streamline these processes
- Optimize resource utilization
- Improve overall healthcare efficiency

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

### 1. **Patient Queue**  
Utilizes a **linked list** to manage patient admission and prioritize based on severity.

### 2. **Blood Inventory**  
Employs **arrays** to track blood units for different blood types, ensuring efficient blood inventory management.

### 3. **Doctor Management**  
Doctors' names are stored in an **array**, facilitating registration and management within the system.

### 4. **Priority Queue Algorithm**  
Implemented for **patient addition**, ensuring efficient handling of patients based on their severity.
